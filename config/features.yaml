# Config file for the feature extraction analyzer.
# A feature extraction definition looks like this:
# name:
#       # Define either a query_string or query_dsl.
#       query_string: *
#       query_dsl:
#       # Mandatory fields.
#       attribute:
#       store_as:
#       re:
#       # Optional fields.
#       emojis: []
#       tags: []
#       create_view: False
#       aggregate: False
#
# Each definition needs to define either a query_string or a query_dsl.
#
# The fields tags and emojis are optional.
#
# The field store_as defines the name of the attribute the feature is
# stored as.
#
# The create_view is an optional boolean that determines whether a view
# should be created if there are hits.
#
# The aggregate is an optional boolean that determines if we want to
# create an aggregation of the results and store it (ATM this does
# nothing, but once aggregations are supported it will).
#
# The feature extraction works in the way that the query is run, and
# the regular expression is run against the attribute to extract a value.
# The first value extracted is then stored inside the "store_as" attribute.
# If there are emojis or tags defined they are also applied to that event.
# In the end, if a view is supposed to be created a view searching for
# the added tag is added (only if there are results).

name: Have there been any executions of PsExec?
type: question
description: >
  PsExec is a command-line tool that allows you to execute commands on remote computers.
  It is part of the Sysinternals suite of tools, which are a collection of free and
  open-source utilities for Windows system administration.  It works by establishing
  a remote connection to the target computer and then executing the specified command.
  The command can be anything that you would normally run on a local computer, such
  as a batch file, a PowerShell script, or a simple command-line instruction.

  description: >-
    Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for PsExec processes being created.

    Windows systems can be set to log new process creation events to the Security
    event log. The logs contain the new process name, process ID, parent process name,
    process creation time, and many more useful fields.

  notes:
    covered:
    - Executions of PsExec on Windows systems with logging enabled.
    not_covered:
    - Many factors can impact log retention; if the event log containing the relevant
      event has been deleted, it won't be found by this approach.
    - Instances when the PsExec executable has been renamed.

- name: Examine Windows Prefetch for evidence of PsExec usage
  description: >-
    Parse Windows Prefetch files and look for PsExec.

    Windows Prefetch files are designed to speed up application start times. To do
    this, they store information about recently launched applications, including the
    file name of the executable and the number of times it has been run.

  notes:
    covered:
    - Executions of PsExec on Windows systems with Prefetch enabled.
    not_covered:
    - Systems where the Prefetch service has been disabled.
    - There is a maximum number of `.pf` allowed by Windows (the number varies by
      Windows version). If too many other Prefetch files were created, the PsExec
      Prefetch file may have been deleted, and thus will not be parsed.
    - Instances when the PsExec executable has been renamed.
    - Non-Windows systems, as the Prefetch service is Windows-only.

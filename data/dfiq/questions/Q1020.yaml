  description: >-
    Parse URL visit records from web browsers' own databases.

    Most web browsers track URL visits (at least in non-Incognito/private sessions)
    in local artifacts on the system. We can collect and review these records. This
    approach is useful when you have remote access to a system (via GRR for example)
    or a disk image.

  notes:
    covered:
    - Chrome URL visits. Beyond "stable" Chrome, this also includes Chromium, Chrome
      Canary, Chrome Beta, and other Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Brave,
      and Opera) on Windows, macOS, and Linux
    - Includes URL visits from all Chrome profiles
    - Firefox URL visits
    - Safari URL visits on Windows and macOS
    - Internet Explorer (4 - 10) URL visits
    not_covered:
    - Other Chromium-based browsers not specified above
    - Browsers installed in non-standard paths
    - Visits made in Incognito/Private sessions

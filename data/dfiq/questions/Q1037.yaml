name: Have there been any executions of PsExeSrv?
type: question
description: >
  PsExec is a command-line tool that allows you to execute commands on remote computers.
  It is part of the Sysinternals suite of tools, which are a collection of free and
  open-source utilities for Windows system administration.  It works by establishing
  a remote connection to the target computer and then executing the specified command.
  In order to do this, it copies an executable to the target system and installs a
  service to run that executable.

  description: >-
    Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for the PsExeSvc service being installed.

    Windows systems can be set to log new service installations to the System event
    log. The logs contain the new service name, service file name, and more. When
    used to access a remote system, PsExec installs a service (by default named `PSEXESVC`)
    on the target system.

  notes:
    covered:
    - Installations of the PsExeSvc Service on Windows systems with logging enabled.
    not_covered:
    - Many factors can impact log retention; if the event log containing the relevant
      event has been deleted, it won't be found by this approach.
    - Instances when the PsExeSvc service has been renamed.

  description: >-
    Parse Windows Prefetch files and look for PsExeSvc.

    Windows Prefetch files are designed to speed up application start times. To do
    this, they store information about recently launched applications, including the
    file name of the executable and the number of times it has been run.

  notes:
    covered:
    - Executions of PsExeSvc on Windows systems with Prefetch enabled.
    not_covered:
    - Systems where the Prefetch service has been disabled.
    - There is a maximum number of `.pf` allowed by Windows (the number varies by
      Windows version). If too many other Prefetch files were created, the PsExec
      Prefetch file may have been deleted, and thus will not be parsed.
    - Instances when the PsExeSvc executable has been renamed.
    - Non-Windows systems, as the Prefetch service is Windows-only.

  description: >-
    Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for PsExeSvc processes being created.

    Windows systems can be set to log new process creation events to the Security
    event log. The logs contain the new process name, process ID, parent process name,
    process creation time, and many more useful fields.

display_name: Which network shares has been mapped?
description: |
  Mapped network shares are a way to access files and folders on other computers
  on a network as if they were local drives. This can be useful for sharing files and
  folders between users and computers, or for accessing files and folders that are
  stored on a central server. Mapped network shares can be used to move laterally within
  a network.

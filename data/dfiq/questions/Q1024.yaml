    CrowdStrike records the source process ID (ContextProcessId) for ProcessRollup
    events.

    Crowdstrike is a detection platform, not a logging platform, so not all executions
    are logged. We cannot always connect a running browser process with observed DNS
    requests. When we do see DNS requests coming from a browser process, yet we don't
    see browsing history, there are several possible explanations, including browser
    extensions or private browsing.

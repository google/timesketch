name: Lateral Movement
type: scenario
description: >
  Lateral movement is the process of an attacker moving from one system to another
  within a network after they have gained initial access to a system. This can be
  done through a variety of methods, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in software,
  using stolen credentials, installing their own remote access tools, or using native
  system utilities.

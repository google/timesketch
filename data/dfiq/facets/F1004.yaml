name: What application was responsible for the DNS query?
type: facet
description: >
  What application made a DNS request is important for determining if it is likely
  legitimate or not. The source also impacts further investigative steps (depending
  on if `powershell.exe` or `chrome.exe` were responsible, different artifacts would
  be useful).

name: Was a user's web browsing the cause of a given DNS query?
type: facet
description: >
  Understanding if a user's actions in a web browser caused a particular DNS query
  is valuable context when investigating a suspicious DNS query. If the query is related
  to the user's actions, closer scrutiny of their browser activity may make sense.
  If the DNS doesn't appear related, you may need to look into the actions of other
  non-browser processes.

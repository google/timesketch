#
# Configuration file for the BigQuery matcher analyzer plugin.
# 
# You can configure several matchers. They should look like this:
#
# matcher_name:
#     event_field_name: sha256_hash
#     bq_project: 'project_name'
#     bq_query: 'SELECT DISTINCT hash FROM project.dataset.tablename WHERE hash IN UNNEST(@sha256_hash)'
#     tags: ['bigquery-sha256-match']
#     emojis: ['SKULL']
#
# The fields are used as follows:
#     * matcher_name: Name for the matcher entry.
#     * event_field_name: Field name in a Timesketch event that you want to match against.
#     * bq_project: Google Cloud Project you want to run the BigQuery job under.
#     * bq_query: Query that is used to match Timesketch events. Results from this query 
#       will be tagged. Match the "IN UNNEST(@sha256_hash)" part to your event_field_name.
#       This example would tag any Timesketch events which have a "sha256_hash" field that
#       has a matching row in BigQuery in the "hash" column.
#     * tags: Tags to apply for matching Timesketch events.
#     * emojis: Emojis to add for matching Timesketch events.

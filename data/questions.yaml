#                       -- Questions --
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a config file to define questions that can be asked
# in Timesketch. These questions define what data needs to be
# present in order to answer the question at hand, as well as
# what user supplied parameters need to be defined and then defines
# a set of analyzers, graph plugins and potential searches will
# be useful in order for you to answer that question.
#
# These questions are then used by investigations, which define a set
# of questions the analyst is attempting to solve, to further guide
# an analyst of what data needs to be collected and what automatic
# analysis can take place to either answer the question, assist with
# answering it or at least guiding the analyst towards the answer.
#
# Each question consists of the following fields:
#       display_name        Simple string that contains the display name that
#                           be used in an UI to describe the question.
#
#       description         Further description of the question, what the
#                           question attempts to answer, whether it will
#                           require further manual analysis, etc.
#
#       data_sources        A list of data sources (as defined in the
#                           data_finder.yaml configuration file) that
#                           either need to be present, should not be
#                           present or are optional in the dataset in
#                           order to be able to answer the question.
#
#       analyzers           A list of analyzers that will be run on the
#                           dataset if all conditions are met in order
#                           to answer the question or further enhance
#                           the dataset.
#
#       graph_plugins       A list of graph plugins that will be run
#                           on the dataset to further guide or assist
#                           the analyst with answering the question.
#
#       parameters          A list of parameters that will be asked
#                           in the investigation, to provide context
#                           needed for the question. This can be
#                           simple things like the username of the user
#                           the analyst is looking at, or a domain that
#                           they are interested in, that is some context
#                           that is needed in order for the question to be
#                           properly asked.
#
#       searches            A list of search templates that will further
#                           assist the analyst to be able to answer the
#                           question.

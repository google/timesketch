# Config file for the feature extraction analyzer.
# A feature extraction definition looks like this:
# name:
#       query_string: *
#       query_dsl:
#       attribute:
#       store_as: 
#       re:
#       emojis: []
#       tags: []
#       create_view: False
#
# Each definition needs to define either a query_string or a query_dsl.
# The fields tags and emojis are optional.
# The field store_as defines the name of the attribute the feature is
# stored as.
# The create_view is an optional boolean that determines whether a view
# should be created if there are hits.
#
# The feature extraction works in the way that the query is run, and
# the chosen attribute is extracted and the regular expression run against
# it. If the regular expression is able to extract value out of the
# attribute field it gets stored as the attribute that is defined in the
# config.

# Configuration file for tags that need highlighting in the intelligence page
#
# For each tag name, the following attributes are defined:
#  * weight: Used for ordering, tags with larger weight will appear first in the list of tags.
#  * class: Used in the UI to defined a Buefy class to color the tag with (common classes are danger, warning, success, and info)
#
# The `regex` attribute is used to specify regexes to match against the tags. 1:1 tag matches take precedence over regex matches.
#
# With the configuration below, an IOC with the 'malware' tag will have that tag displayed first (heavy weight), in red (danger)

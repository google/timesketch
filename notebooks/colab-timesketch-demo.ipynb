Additionally it provides developers with the ability to do research on the data in order to speed up developments of analyzers, aggregators and graphing. The purpose of this colab is simply to briefly introduce the powers of colab to analysts and developers, with the hope of inspiring more to take advantage of this powerful platform. It is also an option to use jupyter notebook instead of colab, both are just as valid options.\n",

You can easily add new code cells, or modify the code that is already there to experiment.\n",

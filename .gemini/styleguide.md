# Style Guide for Gemini Code Assistant (Timesketch-Inspired)

This style guide outlines the coding and documentation standards for the Gemini Code Assistant, drawing inspiration from the Timesketch project's practices and adapting them for the unique context of an AI coding assistant.

## I. Code Style

### A. General Principles

1.  **Readability:** Code should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Favor clarity over cleverness.
2.  **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style throughout the codebase.
3.  **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to modify and extend.
4.  **Efficiency:** Strive for efficient algorithms and data structures, but don't sacrifice readability for minor performance gains.
5.  **Testability:** Design code that is easy to test.

### B. Language-Specific Guidelines

1.  **Python:**
    *   **Adherence to PEP 8:** Follow the official Python style guide (PEP 8) for formatting, naming conventions, and code layout.
    *   **Docstrings:** Use docstrings to explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions, classes, and modules.
    *   **Type Hints:** Employ type hints to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
    *   **Error Handling:** Use exceptions for error handling and provide informative error messages.
    *   **String Formatting:** Use f-strings (or `.format()`) for string formatting. Exceptions being logging messages.
    *   **Imports:** Organize imports into standard library, third-party, and local modules, separated by blank lines.
    *   **Comments:** Use comments to explain non-obvious code or complex logic.
    *   **Pylint:** Use Pylint to enforce code quality and style.
    *   **Quotes:** Quote strings as ' or """ instead of "
    *   **Textual Strings:** Textual strings should be Unicode strings and hence defined as u'string'
    *   **Specifiers:** Use positional or parameter format specifiers with typing e.g. '{0:s}' or '{text:s}' instead of '{0}', '{}' or '{:s}'.
    *   **Exceptions:** When catching exceptions use "as exception:" not some alternative form like "as error:" or "as details:"
    *   **Pylint Overrides:** Use textual pylint overrides e.g. "# pylint: disable=no-self-argument" instead of "# pylint: disable=E0213".

2.  **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
    *   **ESLint:** Use ESLint to enforce code quality and style.
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and components.
    *   **Comments:** Use comments to explain non-obvious code or complex logic.
    *   **Formatting:** Use consistent indentation and spacing.
    *   **Error Handling:** Use try-catch blocks for error handling.
    *   **Asynchronous Code:** Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
    *   **Semicolons:** Do not use semicolons at the end of lines. 

3.  **Other Languages:**
    *   Follow the established style guides and best practices for each language.
    *   Maintain consistency within each language's codebase.

### C. Naming Conventions

1.  **Descriptive Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
2.  **Consistency:** Be consistent in your naming conventions.
3.  **Avoid Abbreviations:** Avoid overly short or cryptic abbreviations.

5.  **Audience:** Consider the intended audience when writing documentation.

### B. Documentation Types

1.  **Code Comments:**
    *   Explain non-obvious code or complex logic.
    *   Keep comments concise and relevant.
    *   Update comments when the code changes.

2.  **Docstrings:**
    *   Use docstrings to explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions, classes, and modules.

3.  **README Files:**
    *   Provide an overview of the project.
    *   Explain how to set up and use the project.
    *   Include examples and usage scenarios.
    *   Link to other relevant documentation.

4.  **API Documentation:**
    *   Document all public APIs.
    *   Explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of each API.
    *   Provide examples of how to use the API.

5.  **Tutorials and Guides:**
    *   Create tutorials and guides for common tasks or use cases.
    *   Provide step-by-step instructions.
    *   Include examples and code snippets.

### C. Markdown Formatting

1.  **Headings:** Use headings to organize the documentation.
2.  **Lists:** Use lists to present items in a clear and concise way.
3.  **Code Blocks:** Use code blocks to display code snippets.
4.  **Emphasis:** Use bold and italic text for emphasis.
5.  **Links:** Use links to refer to other documentation or resources.

## III. Contribution Guidelines

### A. Code Review

1.  **All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.**
2.  **Code should be easy to maintain and understand.**
3.  **Quick-and-dirty solutions are discouraged.**
4.  **At least two reviewers should look over the code.**
5.  **Auto generated UI builds may be merged without review by core project members.**

### B. Documentation Review

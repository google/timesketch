## Context Links

With [#2439](https://github.com/google/timesketch/issues/2439) we introduced context links to the v2 UI. This feature allows linking specific event values to external lookup services for an easy analyst workflow. Now this hash lookup with your favorite CTI platform is just two clicks away.

Check out the [context link documentation](../guides/admin/context-links.md) for more information.

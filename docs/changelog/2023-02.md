## Enhance tsctl list-sigma-rules

Now you can specify the attributes that you want to have printed for the rules. This can be useful for things like this.

```bash
tsctl list-sigma-rules --columns=rule_uuid,title,status
rule_uuid,title,status
['8c10509b-9ba5-4387-bf6c-e347931b646f', 'SigmaRuleTemplateTitledddd', 'experimental']
['5266a592-b793-11ea-b3de-0242ac130004', 'Suspicious Installation of Zenmap', 'experimental']
['e5684ad6-5824-4680-9cc5-e8f0babd77bb', 'Foobar', 'experimental']
tsctl list-sigma-rules --columns=rule_uuid,title,status | grep experimental | wc -l
3
```

## Bugfixes

### don't mutate the prop (#2542)

### use a fixed id if crypto.randomUUID is not available (#2537)

In Sigma Rule templates, the code still tried to generate a random UUID, this was causing problems if the connection to TImesketch was not in a HTTPS connection. This is being fixed now.

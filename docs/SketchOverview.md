# Sketches

Sketches are a way to organise analysis of events across multiple timelines and increase data discoverability via search, targeted views, comments and stories. 

## Creating a sketch
To create a new sketch, click “New Sketch” button on the tool’s homepage. After that you will be redirected straight onto Overview page of your new sketch. Here you can click “Edit” icon to give your sketch a name and enter a description.

Now you need to add timelines to your new sketch. To do so, you can click “Import Timeline” and upload a file in Plaso, CSV or JSONL formats. More details about importing timelines are in chapter “Importing timelines”

Alternatively, you can go to “Timelines” tab and select from all available timelines.

## Navigating a sketch
A sketch consists of 5 tabs: “Overview”, “Explore”, “Stories”, “Views” and “Timelines”.

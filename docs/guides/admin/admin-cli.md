## tsctl

tsctl is a command-line tool for managing and interacting with a Timesketch instance. It allows users to create and delete sketches, add and remove data sources, manage users and groups, and perform various other tasks.

Its commands can be accessed by running tsctl followed by the desired subcommand. For example, to list all the available sketches in a Timesketch instance, tsctl list-sketches can be run.

### Config

The `--config` parameter in tsctl is used to specify the location of a configuration file that contains settings for tsctl. This configuration file can specify default values for various tsctl options, such as the `hostname` and `port` of the Timesketch server, the `username` and `password` to use when authenticating with the server, and other settings.

Parameters:

```shell
--config / -c (optional)
```

Example

```shell
tsctl run -c /etc/timesketch/timesketch.conf
```

### version

Displays the version of Timesketch installed on the system

Example

```shell
tsctl version
Timesketch version: 20210602
```

### info

Displays various useful version information used on the system Timesketch is installed on.

Example

```shell
tsctl info
Timesketch version: 20210602
plaso - psort version 20220930
Node version: v14.20.1
npm version: 6.14.17
yarn version: 1.22.19
Python version: Python 3.10.6
pip version: pip 22.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10)
```

### User management

#### Adding users

tsctl provides a subcommand for creating users in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `create-user`, and it allows you to specify the `username`, `password`, and other details for the user you want to create.

To use the `create-user` subcommand, you would run `tsctl create-user` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to create a user with the username "john" and the password "123456", you could run the following command: `tsctl create-user --username john --password 123456`.

Once the user is created, they will be able to log in to the Timesketch instance using their username and password. You can then use the list-users subcommand to verify that the user was created successfully.

Command:

```shell
tsctl create-user
```

Parameters:

```shell
--name / -n
--password / -p (optional)
```

Example

```shell
tsctl create-user foo
```

#### Change user password

To change a user password, the create-user command can be used, as it is checking if the user exists if yes it will update the update.

This command would change the password of the user with the specified username to the new password provided. The user will then be able to log in to the Timesketch instance using their new password.

Command:

```shell
tsctl create-user
```

Parameters:

```shell
--username / -u
--password / -p (optional)
```

Example

```shell
tsctl create-user foo
```

#### Removing users

tsctl provides a subcommand for disabling users in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `disable-user`, and it allows you to specify the username or user ID of the user you want to disable.

To use the `disable-user` subcommand, you would run `tsctl disable-user` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to disable a user with the username "john", you could run the following command:
`tsctl disable-user john`.

This command would disable the user with the specified username, preventing them from logging in to the Timesketch instance. However, their user account will still exist in the system, and you can use the enable-user subcommand to re-enable their account at any time.

Disabled users are not removed from the system, but marked as disabled.
The current implementation is not complete. Disabled users will still show up for other commands.

Command:

```shell
tsctl disable_user
tsctl enable_user
```


Example

```shell
tsctl disable_user foo
tsctl enable_user foo
```

#### List users

tsctl provides a subcommand for listing the users in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `list-users`, and it allows you to view a list of the users in the system, along with their username, user ID, and other details.

To use the `list-users` subcommand, you would run `tsctl list-users` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to list all the users in the Timesketch instance, you could run the following command: `tsctl list-users`.

This command would display a list of the users in the Timesketch instance, along with their username and other details.

Example

```shell
tsctl list-users
foo
bar
dev (admin)
```

#### Make admin

tsctl provides a subcommand for granting administrator privileges to a user in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `make-admin`, and it allows you to specify the username of the user you want to grant administrator privileges to.

To use the `make-admin` subcommand, you would run `tsctl make-admin` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to grant administrator privileges to a user with the username "john", you could run the following command: `tsctl make-admin  john`

This command would grant the user with the specified username administrator privileges.

Once a user has administrator privileges, they will be able to perform a wider range of tasks in the Timesketch instance. You can use the `list-users` subcommand to verify that the user has been granted administrator privileges successfully.

You can use `tsctl revoke-admin` to revoke admin privileges.

#### Revoke admin

tsctl provides a subcommand for revoking administrator privileges from a user in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `revoke-admin`, and it allows you to specify the username of the user you want to revoke administrator privileges from.

To use the `revoke-admin` subcommand, you would run `tsctl revoke-admin` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to revoke administrator privileges from a user with the username "john", you could run the following command: `tsctl revoke-admin john`

This command would revoke the administrator privileges of the user with the specified username.

Once a user's administrator privileges are revoked, they will no longer be able to perform tasks that require administrator privileges in the Timesketch instance. You can use the `list-users` subcommand to verify that the user's administrator privileges have been revoked successfully.

### Group management

#### Adding groups

tsctl provides a subcommand for adding groups in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `add-group`, and it allows you to specify the name and description of the group you want to add.

To use the `add-group` subcommand, you would run tsctl add-group followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to add a group called "analysts" with the description "Group for analysts", you could run the following command: `tsctl add-group --name analysts --description "Group for analysts"`
This command would create a new group with the specified name and description. Once the group is created, you can use the `list-groups` subcommand to verify that the group was added successfully.

You can also use the `add-user-to-group` subcommand to add users to the group you have created. This allows you to manage the members of the group, and control which users have access to the sketches and data sources associated with the group.

Command:

```shell
tsctl add_group
```

Parameters:

```shell
--name / -n
```

#### Removing groups

Not yet implemented.

#### Managing group membership

##### Add a suer to a group

tsctl provides a subcommand for adding users to a group in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `add-group-member`, and it allows you to specify the username of the user you want to add to the group, as well as the name of the group you want to add the user to.

To use the `add-group-member` subcommand, you would run `tsctl add-group-member` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to add a user with the username "john" to a group called "analysts", you could run the following command: `tsctl add-group-member --username john --group-name analysts`.
This command would add the user with the specified username to the group with the specified name.

Once the user is added to the group, they will be able to access the sketches and data sources associated with the group, based on the permissions granted to the group. You can use the `list-groups` subcommand to verify that the user was added to the group successfully.

Command:

```shell
tsctl add-group-member
```

Example:

```shell
tsctl add-group-member --username john --group-name analysts
```

##### Removing a group member

tsctl provides a subcommand for removing users from a group in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `remove-group-member`, and it allows you to specify the username of the user you want to remove from the group, as well as the name of the group you want to remove the user from.

To use the `remove-group-member` subcommand, you would run `tsctl remove-group-member` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to remove a user with the username "john" from a group called "analysts", you could run the following command: `tsctl remove-group-member --username john --group-name analysts`

This command would remove the user with the specified username from the group with the specified name.

Once the user is removed from the group, they will no longer be able to access the sketches and data sources associated with the group. You can use the list-groups subcommand to verify that the user was removed from the group successfully.


Command:

```shell
tsctl remove-group-member
```

Example:

```shell
tsctl remove-group-member --username john --group-name analysts
```

### add_index

```shell
tsctl add_index -u user_foo -i test_index_name -n sample
```

### routes

tsctl provides a subcommand for displaying the available API routes in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `routes`, and it allows you to view a list of the API routes that are available in the Timesketch instance, along with their URL and description.

To use the routes subcommand, you would run `tsctl routes` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to list all the available API routes in the Timesketch instance, you could run the following command: `tsctl routes`.
This command would display a list of the available API routes in the Timesketch instance, along with their URL and description.

Example:

```bash
tsctl routes
Endpoint                           Methods            Rule
---------------------------------  -----------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
aggregationexploreresource         POST               /api/v1/sketches/<int:sketch_id>/aggregation/explore/
```

### db

tsctl provides a subcommand for managing the database in a Timesketch instance. This subcommand is called `db`, and it allows you to perform various operations on the Timesketch database, such as creating the database tables, initializing the database schema, and migrating the database to the latest version.

To use the `db` subcommand, you would run `tsctl db` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to initialize the database schema in the Timesketch instance, you could run the following command:
`tsctl db init`

Command:

```shell
tsctl db
```

Example

```bash
tsctl db --help
Usage: tsctl db [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Perform database migrations.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  branches   Show current branch points
  current    Display the current revision for each database.
  downgrade  Revert to a previous version
  edit       Edit a revision file
  heads      Show current available heads in the script directory
  history    List changeset scripts in chronological order.
  init       Creates a new migration repository.
  merge      Merge two revisions together, creating a new revision file
  migrate    Autogenerate a new revision file (Alias for 'revision...
  revision   Create a new revision file.
  show       Show the revision denoted by the given symbol.
  stamp      'stamp' the revision table with the given revision; don't...
  upgrade    Upgrade to a later version
```


#### Upgrade DB After Schema Change

After changing the schema for the database a revision file needs to be generated.

(temporary solution)
Before doing the database migration you'll need to modify the file `timesketch/models/__init__.py`:

```python

def init_db():
...
        BaseModel.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

This line needs to be commented out, eg:

```python

def init_db():
...
        #BaseModel.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

Then inside the timesketch container, to generate the file use the command:

```shell
cd /usr/local/src/timesketch/timesketch
tsctl db stamp head
tsctl db upgrade
```

This makes sure that the database is current. Then create a revision file:

```shell
tsctl db migrate -m "<message>"
```

Once the migration is done, remove the comment to re-enable the line in `timesketch/models/__init.py`.

##### Troubleshooting Database Schema Changes

If the migration file is not created, which could be an indication that the schema change
is not detected by the automation one can create an empty revision file:

```shell
tsctl db revision
```

And then fill in the blanks, see examples of changes in `timesketch/migrations/versions/*_.py`.

### Drop database

Will drop all databases.

Command:

```shell
tsctl drop_db
```

### search_template

```shell
tsctl import
```

Parameters:

```shell
--file / -f
--sketch_id / -s      (optional)

```

### Shell

tsctl provides a subcommand for starting an interactive Python shell with the Timesketch API client pre-initialized. This subcommand is called `shell`, and it allows you to access the Timesketch API and perform various operations using the Python interpreter.

To use the `shell` subcommand, you would run `tsctl shell` followed by the desired options and arguments. For example, to start an interactive Python shell with the Timesketch API client pre-initialized, you could run the following command: `tsctl shell`.

### Context Links Configuration

We can use `tsctl` to test the yaml config file for the context link feature.
This is especially useful if an entry that is added to the configuration file
does not show up as a context link in the frontend.

```
tsctl validate-context-links-conf <PATH TO CONFIG FILE>
```

The default config can be found at `data/context_links.yaml` .

The output will tell if there is a value not matching the schema requirements:

**No error:** All entries in the configuration file match the schema requirements.

```
$ tsctl validate-context-links-conf ./context_links.yaml
=> OK: "virustotal"
=> OK: "unfurl"
=> OK: "mseventid"
=> OK: "urlhaus"
```

**With an error:** Here the validator tells us that there is an error with the
replacement pattern in the `context_link` entry.

```
$ tsctl validate-context-links-conf ./context_links.yaml
=> ERROR: "virustotal" >> 'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/<ATTR_VALUE' does not match '<ATTR_VALUE>'

Failed validating 'pattern' in schema['properties']['context_link']:
    {'pattern': '<ATTR_VALUE>', 'type': 'string'}

On instance['context_link']:
    'https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/<ATTR_VALUE'

=> OK: "unfurl"
=> OK: "mseventid"
=> OK: "urlhaus"
```

### Analyzer-stats

`tsctl`offers a method called `analyzer-stats` to display various information about analyzer runs of the past.

To use the `analyzer-stats` subcommand, you would run `tsctl analyzer-stats` followed by the desired options and arguments.

```shell
tsctl analyzer-stats
```

Example:

```shell
tsctl analyzer-stats --help
Usage: tsctl analyzer-stats [OPTIONS] ANALYZER_NAME

  Prints analyzer stats.

Options:
  --timeline_id TEXT         Timeline ID if the analyzer results should be
                             filtered by timeline.
  --scope TEXT               Scope on: [many_hits, long_runtime, recent]
  --result_text_search TEXT  Search in result text. E.g. for a specific
                             rule_id.
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
tsctl analyzer-stats sigma --scope many_hits --result_text_search 71a52
     runtime  hits                                                                          result  analysis_id                 created_at

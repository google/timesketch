## Troubleshooting playbook

- Is it only affecting one user?
- Is it only affecting one sketch / timeline?
- Can the issue be reproduced on demo.timesketch.org?
- Can the issue be reproduced on a different device / clear caches from browser?
- Any errors in Chrome console for any javascript errors or failed HTTP requests
- Any errors in nginx / webserver logs?
- Any errors in Timesketch / celery worker logs
- Any errors in ES logs?
- Any errors in postgres logs?

## Frontend issues

To troubleshoot web frontend issues, the first look should go to the Chrome developer console and look for any output / errors.

To raise issues related to the web frontend, please provide the following:

- Copy out the full error message(s) from Chrome Console
- The URL (without your local IP or Domain)
- What was clicked before it happend
- Any entries in the server side logs (see below)?
- Share a screenshot if possible
- If possible details about the event / sketch
  - Was it an imported plaso file or CSV or JSONL?
  - Was the data imported via Web or API client?

## Docker

To list all your running Docker containers, run:

```shell
docker container list
```

Which will show something like

```shell
b756f334d281   us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/timesketch/dev:latest        "/docker-entrypoint.…"   8 days ago   Up 2 days   127.0.0.1:5000->5000/tcp             timesketch-dev

```

If one of these is not up, you might need to troubleshoot docker.

## Troubleshooting Database Schema Changes

See [docs/learn/server-admin](docs/learn/server-admin#troubleshooting-database-schema-changes)

## Issues importing plaso file

- Which plaso version is installed on the Timesketch server?
- Which plaso version was used to create the plaso file?
- Is the issue for both web upload and `import_client`?

Try to run the following in the Docker container after the file was uploaded (but not successfully imported):

```shell
pinfo.py $FILENAME
```

Should give the following error message:

```shell
2020-08-19 14:40:48,912 [ERROR] (MainProcess) PID:568 <pinfo_tool> Format of storage file: $FILENAME not supported
```

## Logs

All of those are subject to change depending on your operating system.

### Nginx / webserver

```shell
/var/log/nginx/access
```

Good starter is to run the following grep:

```shell
grep "http_code:500" /var/log/nginx/access.log  # to get all Error 500
```

If you started the webserver with docker, look in the console where you started:

```shell
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID gunicorn --reload -b 0.0.0.0:5000 --log-file --timeout 600 timesketch.wsgi:application
```

Or run the following where `$CONTAINER_ID` is the ID from your `timesketch-dev` or `timesketch` Docker container.

```shell
docker logs $CONTAINER_ID
```

### Timesketch / Celery worker

See your console output if you started the workers with:

```shell
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID celery -A timesketch.lib.tasks worker --loglevel=debug
```

### Elasticsearch

```shell
/var/log/elasticsearch
```

Or run the following where `$CONTAINER_ID` is the ID from your `elasticsearch` Docker container.

```shell
docker logs $CONTAINER_ID
```

### Postgress

```shell
/var/log/postgresql/
```

Or run the following where `$CONTAINER_ID` is the ID from your `postgres` Docker container.

```shell
docker logs $CONTAINER_ID
```

## CSRF token expire

You can edit `/etc/timesketch/timesketch.conf` and add:

```
WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT = 1234 # seconds or "None" to never expire.
```

The default is 3600s.

Restart the webserver and the new value is used.

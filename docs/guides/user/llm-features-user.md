# LLM Features Settings

Timesketch includes experimental features leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance analysis capabilities. These features include event summarization and AI-generated queries (NL2Q - Natural Language to Query). This document outlines the steps required for users to enable these features.

**Note:** This requires your Timesketch administrator to have [set-up the necessary LLM configuration](../admin/llm-features.md).

## Enabling LLM Features (users)

Users can control the LLM features through the Settings dialog in the Timesketch UI. These settings are configured on a per-user/per-instance basis, not per Sketch.

1.  **Access the Settings Dialog:** Log in to Timesketch and navigate to the "Settings" section (usually found in the user menu).
2.  **Enable/Disable Main Switch:** A main switch is available to enable or disable all experimental AI features.
3.  **Individual Feature Controls:**  Within the Settings dialog, you'll find individual switches to control, such as:
    *   LLM event summarization
    *   AI-generated queries (NL2Q)

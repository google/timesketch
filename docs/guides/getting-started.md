# Getting started

### Installing Timesketch

If you don't have your own Timesketch server yet the first step is to install one.
Follow these instructions to get started:

- [Installing Timesketch](admin/install.md)

### Uploading your first timeline

When you have a Timesketch server setup it is time to upload some data.
Timesketch supports Plaso storage files as well as CSV and JSON formatted files.

- [Uploading timelines to Timesketch](user/upload-data.md)
- [Creating a timeline from JSON or CSV](user/import-from-json-csv.md)

### Search and explore

The tagger analyzer tags events that match a specific search filter. Different
searches and different tags can be specified in the `tags.yaml` file.

### Configuration attributes

Each `tags.yaml` entry must define either a `query_string` or a `query_dsl`. This
is the filter that will be used to select events that should be tagged.

`save_search` is an optional boolean that determines whether a saved
search should be created if there are hits for the aforementioned query.
The name of the saved search is defined through the `search_name` attribute.

`tags` and `emojis` are arrays of tags or emojis that will be applied to
matching events.

The tagger analyzer will iterate over the matching events, and apply all
specified tags and emojis to each event. Only if tagging happens will the saved
searches be created.

A simple configuration looks like this:

```yaml
test_tagger:
    query_string: 'test'
    tags: ['test-tag']
    emojis: ['FISHING_POLE']
    save_search: true
    search_name: 'TEST the tag'
```

With the above entry, events matching the search query `test` will be tagged with `test-tag` and
have the `FISHING_POLE` emoji attached to them. If any events are tagged, a saved search containing this
events will be created and called `TEST the tag`.

### Advanced configuration

The tagger analyzer supports some more advanced configuration for selecting and
tagging events.

#### Regular expression matching

`regular_expression` and `re_attribute` can be used to further narrow down
which events to tag.

If specified, `regular_expression` will be checked on the attribute specified in
`re_attribute`, and only if it matches will the tags / emojis be applied to that
event.

Regular expression flags can be passed through the `re_flags` attribute.
Possible values are the flags supported by Python's `re` module:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.A

Given the following configuration:

```yaml
test_tagger:
    query_string: 'test'
    tags: ['secure']
    save_search: true
    search_name: 'HTTPS requests'
    regular_expression: '^https://'
    re_attribute: 'message'
    re_flags: ['IGNORECASE']
```

all events matching the query `test` will initially be selected, and for each
, the regular expression `^http://` with the `IGNORECASE` flag will be applied
to the event's `message` attribute. If there is a match, the event will be
tagged `'secure'`. If events are tagged this way, a saved search called
`'HTTPS requests'` will be created.

### Dynamic tagging

Dynamic tagging allows to tag events with values derived from event attributes.

Consider events that have a `yara_match` attribute that specify which Yara rule
matched a specific file (this is the default behavior of timelines generated by Plaso).

By prefixing a tag name with `$` (e.g. `'$yara_match'`), the value of the tag
applied to the event will be the value of the event's `yara_match` attribute.

Dynamic tagging also supports modifiers, such as `split` or `upper`. These modifiers are
defined in the `MODIFIERS` class attribute of the `TaggerSketchPlugin` class.
They are applied sequentially to the extracted attribute value.

Using this example configuration:

```yaml
yara_match_tagger:
  query_string: '_exists_:yara_match AND NOT yara_match.keyword:"-"'
  tags: ['yara', '$yara_match']
  modifiers: ['split']
  save_search: true
  search_name: 'Yara rule matches'
```

and considering an event that has the following attribute:

```
yara_match: 'yara_rule1 yara_rule2'
```

Using the `split` modifier will split the value of `yara_match` into
`['yara_rule1', 'yara_rule2']`. These will be applied as individual tags to
the event, along with `yara`, which was specified without a leading `$`.

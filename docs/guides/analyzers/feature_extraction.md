The feature extraction analyzer creates attributes out of event data based on
different extraction plugins.

Currently supported:
* Regular expression based extractions
  * [Regex Extraction Plugin](#regex-extraction-plugin)
* Plaso parsed windows event logs
  * [Winevt Extraction Plugin](#winevt-extraction-plugin)

> **Note**
Please be aware that this analyzer does *not* extract ipv4, email addresses and
similar from *all* events, but only those that match the definitions configured
for the plugins explained below!

### Use case

This analyzer is helpful to extract additional data from events as separate
attributes. Those extracted attributes can then be used in search, lookups,
correlations, aggregations or with analyzers.

For example: In the default configuration, the analyzer will extract
`email_addresses` from the message field of events with the source `WEBHIST`
matching the regular expression.

## Regex Extraction Plugin

This feature extraction plugin uses regular expression to extract matching
strings from an existing event attribute (e.g. message) and adds it as a new
attribute to the event.

### Configuration

Features are defined in [data/regex_features.yaml](../../../data/regex_features.yaml)

A regex based feature extraction definition looks like this:

```
name:
       # Define either a query_string or query_dsl.
       query_string: *
       query_dsl:
       # Mandatory fields.
       attribute:
       store_as:
       re:
       # Optional fields.
       re_flags: []
       emojis: []
       tags: []
       create_view: False
       aggregate: False
       overwrite_store_as: True
       overwrite_and_merge_store_as: False
       store_type_list: False
       keep_multimatch: False
```

Each definition needs to define either a `query_string` or a `query_dsl`.

`re_flags` is a list of flags as strings from the `re` module. These include:
- DEBUG
- DOTALL
- IGNORECASE
- LOCALE
- MULTILINE
- TEMPLATE
- UNICODE
- VERBOSE

The fields `tags` and `emojis` are optional.

The field `store_as` defines the name of the attribute the feature is stored as.

The `create_view` is an optional boolean that determines whether a view should be created if there are hits.

The `aggregate` is an optional boolean that determines if we want to create an aggregation of the results and store it (ATM this does nothing, but once aggregations are supported it will).

The `overwrite_store_as` is an optional boolean that determines if we want to overwrite the field `store_as` if it already exists.

The `overwrite_and_merge_store_as` is an optional boolean that determines  if we want to overwrite the field `store_as` and merge the existing values.

The `store_type_list` is an optional boolean that determines if we want to store the extracted data in List type (default is text).

The `keep_multimatch` is an optional boolean that determines if we want to store all matching results (default store first result).

The feature extraction works in the way that the query is run, and the regular expression is run against the attribute to extract a value.
The first value extracted is then stored inside the "store_as" attribute.
If there are emojis or tags defined they are also applied to that event.
In the end, if a view is supposed to be created a view searching for the added tag is added (only if there are results).

## Winevt Extraction Plugin

This feature extraction plugin uses configured mappings to create new attributes
for Windows Event Log events that were parsed using [Plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso).

The mapping is based on the `strings` array, that gets generated by Plaso for
the event data entries.

> **Note**
The winevt extraction plugin does *not* map all Windows Event Log fields. It
does only map the ones configured in [data/winevt_features.yaml](../../../data/winevt_features.yaml)!

### Configuration

Features are defined in [data/winevt_features.yaml](../../../data/winevt_features.yaml)

A mapping for a Windows Event uses the yaml format and looks like this:

```
name:

    source_name:            Type: list[str] | REQUIRED | case-insensitive
                            A list of source names to match against. Multiple
                            entries will be checked with OR.

    provider_identifier:    Type: list[str] | OPTIONAL | case-insensitive
                            A list of provider identifiers to match against.
                            Multiple entries will be checked with OR.

    event_version:          Type: int | REQUIRED
                            The event version to match against.

    event_identifier:       Type: int | REQUIRED
                            The event identifier to match against.

    references:             Type: list[str] | OPTIONAL
                            A list of references to provide as context and
                            source for the event mapping. E.g. a URL to the
                            official Microsoft documentation on the event.

    mapping:                Type: list[dict] | REQUIRED
                            A list of dicts that define the new attribute name
                            and the string index of the event to extract the
                            value from. Additionally it can also contain an
                            alias list to add multiple attributes with
                            the same value but different names.

        name:               Type: str | REQUIRED
                            The name of the new attribute to create.

        string_index:       Type: int | REQUIRED | Starting at index 0
                            The string index of the event to extract the
                            value from. Based on the plaso extracted "strings"
                            attribute with Windows eventlog entries.

        aliases:            Type: list[str] | OPTIONAL
                            A list of aliases to add additionally to the
                            official name of the attribute. This can be used
                            to add different field names matching individual
                            field name ontologies. E.g. srcIP, domain, etc.

## Black Hat Arsenal: Timesketch - AI-Powered Super Timeline Analysis

Come see a demonstration of the new Investigation View workflow. We'll
showcase how an analyst can trigger an external AI agent to process millions of
events, automatically generating and populating Digital Forensics Investigative
Questions (DFIQ). Discover how this AI-assisted workflow helps analysts rapidly
triage findings, synthesize conclusions, and accelerate the reporting process.

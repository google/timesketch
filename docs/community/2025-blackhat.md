# Timesketch at Black Hat USA 2025 & defcon 33

## Presenting a New Workflow for AI-Driven Forensic Analysis

The Timesketch team is excited to introduce a new feature for collaborative
forensics: **(AI)Investigation Views** supercharged with external AI agents for
timeline analysis. Instead of building a monolithic "AI feature" inside Timesketch,
we have developed a robust workflow that leverages specialized, external AI
reasoning agents to process timeline data at scale.

Join our sessions to learn how this hybrid architecture enables a new class of
automated investigation.

## Black Hat Briefing: Autonomous Timeline Analysis and Threat Hunting - An AI Agent for Timesketch

The Timesketch team has partnerd with the Sec-Gemini research team to develop an
Log Reasoning Agent. This session will dive deeper into the architecture,
capabilities, and development of the Sec-Gemini Log Reasoning Agent. We will
discuss the challenges and breakthroughs in creating an AI for log analysis.

## Black Hat Arsenal: Timesketch - AI-Powered Super Timeline Analysis

Come see a demonstration of the new Investigation View workflow. We'll
showcase how an analyst can trigger an external AI agent to process millions of
events, automatically generating and populating Digital Forensics Investigative
Questions (DFIQ). Discover how this AI-assisted workflow helps analysts rapidly
triage findings, synthesize conclusions, and accelerate the reporting process.

## defcon 33

We will be doing some presentations and demos at the [AI Village at defcon 33](https://aivillage.org/events/defcon33/).
Come and discuss with us the challenges of working with AI in DFIR investigations
and explore a demonstration of the AI Investigation View in Timesketch.

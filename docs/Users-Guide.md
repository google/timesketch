## Concepts

Timesketch is built on multiple sketches, where one sketch is usually one case.
Every sketch can consist of multiple timelines with multiple views.

### Sketches

### Adding Timelines

* [Create timeline from JSON/JSONL/CSV file](/docs/CreateTimelineFromJSONorCSV.md)
* [Create timeline from Plaso file](/docs/CreateTimelineFromPlaso.md)
* [Enable Plaso upload via HTTP](/docs/EnablePlasoUpload.md)

### Adding event

To manually adding an event, visit the sketch view. Within that screen, there is the possibility to star an event, hide an event as well as add a manual event (marked with a little +).
This event will have the previously selected time pre-filled but can be changed.

### Views

#### Hiding events from a view

All about reducing noise in the result views.
Hit the little eye to hide events from the list making it possible to
curate views to emphasize the important things.
The events are still there and can be easily shown for those who want to see them.
Hit the big red button to show/hide the events.

### Heatmap

The heatmap aggregation calculates on which day of the week and at which hour events happened. This can be very useful e.g. when analyzing lateral movement or login events.

### Stories

A story is a place where you can capture the narrative of your technical investigation and add detail to your story with raw timeline data.
The editor let you to write and capture the story behind your investigation and at the same time enable you to share detailed findings without spending hours writing reports.

you can add events from previously saved searches.
Just hit enter to start a new paragraph and choose the saved search from the dropdown menu.

## Searching

All data within Timesketch is stored in elasticsearch. So the search works similar to ES.

Using the advances search, a JSON can be passed to Timesketch
```json
{
	"query": {
		"bool": {
			"must": [
				{
					"query_string": {
						"query": "*"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"sort": {
		"datetime": "asc"
	}
}
```

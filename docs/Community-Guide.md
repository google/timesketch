### IRC channel
We have a Timesketch channel (#timesketch) on the Freenode network.  
Use your favorite IRC client or try the [Freenode web based IRC client](http://webchat.freenode.net/).

### Slack community
Join the [Timesketch Slack community](https://timesketch.slack.com/) by sending an email to get-slack-invite@timesketch.org.  
You will get an invite in your inbox as soon as possible.

**Why do I need to email you to get access to the Slack community?**  
A: Because Slack doesn't have a "Request access to this community" feature and I need an email address to send the invite to. If you have a better idea than sending me (Johan) an email to get an invite please feel free to reach out via IRC (j4711 on freenode) or send a [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/jberggren).

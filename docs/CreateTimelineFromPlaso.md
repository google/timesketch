# Create timeline from Plaso file

You need to run version >= 1.5.0 Plaso on your Timesketch server. See the [official Plaso documentation](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Ubuntu-Packaged-Release) for installing Plaso and it's dependencies. If you haven't installed Timesketch yet, take a look at the [installation instructions](Installation.md).

When you have working installations of Timesketch and Plaso you can, from the command line, do:

    $ psort.py -o timesketch -h
    Optional arguments for output modules:
      --name NAME           The name of the timeline in Timesketch. Default:
                            hostname if present in the storage file. If no
                            hostname is found then manual input is used.
      --index INDEX         The name of the Elasticsearch index. Default: Generate
                            a random UUID
      --flush_interval FLUSH_INTERVAL
                            The number of events to queue up before sent in bulk
                            to Elasticsearch. Default: 1000

All of the above arguments are optional. If you don't provide a name for your timeline the module will try to extract the hostname from the Plaso storage file and if this fails it will prompt you to enter a name.

So all that is needed is:

    $ psort.py -o timesketch dump.plaso

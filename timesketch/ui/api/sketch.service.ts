/**
 * A service that is intended to gather most of the resources defined in
 * @see {@link https://github.com/google/timesketch/blob/master/timesketch/api/v1/resources.py}
 * For convenience, this service stores sketch id as a property. Each method
 * implicitly operates in context of this particular sketch. It is intended
 * that a root component provides this service to other components and is
 * responsible for setting {@link SketchService#sketchId}. Functionality that is
 * linked to a sketch but is conceptually separate should be placed in other
 * services that depend on SketchService, such as GraphService. These services
 * should also implicitly operate in context of the sketch pointed to by
 * {@link SketchService#sketchId}.

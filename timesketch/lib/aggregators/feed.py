"""Feed aggregation.

This file provides a manual feed aggregator. This is useful for analyzers
that have already done the aggregation inside the analyzer, as part of the
analysis work they do. Instead of adding attributes to all events or
redo the aggregation each time the analyzer can simply store the aggregation
results as part of the parameters to the manual aggregator. That way the
aggregation can be used to generate charts and tables in stories and stored
insights. This analyzer is not useful for UI and therefore is "hidden" from
views.

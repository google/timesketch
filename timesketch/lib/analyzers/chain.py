    """Sketch analyzer for chained events.

    The purpose of the chain analyzer is to chain together events that can
    be described as linked, either by sharing some common entities, or
    one event being a derivative of another event. An example of this
    would be that a browser downloads an executable, which then later gets
    executed. The signs of execution could lie in multiple events, from
    different sources, but they are all linked or chained together. This
    could help an analyst see the connection between these separate but
    chained events. Another example could be a document written and then
    compressed into a ZIP file, which would then be exfilled through some
    means. If the document and the ZIP file are chained together it could be
    easier for the analyst to track the meaning of an exfil event involving the
    compressed file.
